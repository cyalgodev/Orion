Well a little bit about me, I'm very new to programming, but the interest in programming stemmed from wanting to learn how to become a white hat to be able to help
those who couldn't really help themselves and prevent damage to their livelihoods. The more I researched and studied a few tools, the more I enjoyed the programming
aspect of it. I jumped into learning Python first, and into a project with one of my closest friends. 

I'm not super skilled enough to be much help when it comes to the programming, but I'm hoping with determination and persistence, I'll get there!
